Examples of Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
============================================

In this project we use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) as implemented in
`minisom package`_ for unsupervised learning of artificial neural
network.

.. The problem to solve include finding
.. similarities between

..  #. physical characteristics of wild animals and insects in a zoo
   (dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/),

.. #. students interests in school (self-generated dataset).

.. _minisom package: https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom
